## Hi, I'm Wzyss!

I'm a furry techie who loves sharing my experiences with technology. I'm also a big fan of furry art and culture, and I'm always looking for new ways to combine my love of technology and my love of boops.

I'm always up for a challenge, and I love learning new things. I'm also a bit of a nerd, and I can talk your ear off about any subject I have knowledge in.

If you're interested in learning more about me, or if you just want to chat, feel free to check out my <a href="https://itswzyss.com" target="_blank">personal site</a> to get in touch. I'm always happy to meet new people!
